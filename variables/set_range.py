# The range of a set of values is the maximum value minus the minimum
# value. Define a procedure, set_range, which returns the range of three input
# values.

# Hint: the procedure, biggest which you coded in this unit
# might help you with this question. You might also like to find a way to
# code it using some built-in functions.

def set_range(n,m,p):
    result=max(n,m,p)+max(-n,-m,-p)
    return result
